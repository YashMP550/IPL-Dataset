This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for exploring **Indian Premier League (IPL)** data using the Python data stack.
It covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clear plots that highlight trends across seasons,
teams, players, venues, and toss/match outcomes.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
.
├── IPL-DATA-ANALYSIS.ipynb   # Main notebook with the full analysis
├── README.md                 # You're reading it
└── data/                     # (optional) place raw CSVs here if you add them
```

## ✨ What’s Inside

- **Data Cleaning**: fixing column types, handling missing values, and preparing tidy data.
- **EDA**: season-wise trends, team performance, player stats, venue patterns, and toss vs. result relationships.
- **Visualizations**: line charts, bar charts, and pie/donut plots built with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- **Reproducible notebook**: cells are organized to re-run end-to-end.

> Tip: If you plan to publish your dataset as part of the repository, put it inside `data/` and update the paths in the notebook.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-data-analysis.git
cd ipl-data-analysis
```

### 2) Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4) Launch Jupyter
```bash
jupyter notebook IPL-DATA-ANALYSIS.ipynb
```

---

## 🧰 Requirements

The project uses the standard Python data stack. A minimal `requirements.txt` is included.
If you later add libraries (e.g., plotly, scikit-learn, streamlit), add them to `requirements.txt` as well.

```
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
jupyter
```

## 🔍 Example Analyses (covered in the notebook)

- Toss decision vs. match outcome
- Team performance across seasons
- Venue-wise win patterns
- Top batters/bowlers by season
- Season-over-season trends in runs/wickets

---

## 🧪 Reproducibility

- All random operations (if any) should set a seed before plotting/modeling.
- Keep raw data immutable; write cleaned/intermediate artifacts to a `data/processed/` folder (if used).

---

## 📦 Exporting Results

- Save key plots as PNGs into a `reports/figures/` directory (optional).
- Consider exporting summary tables to CSV for quick viewing in GitHub.
